### Overview
This C++ program, developed for CS300 Homework 1, is designed to solve mazes using a stack-based approach. The application prompts users to input details about multiple mazes, including the number of mazes, the dimensions of each maze (rows and columns), and specific information about the maze's entrance, exit, and visited blocks.

### Program Structure
- **Main Program:**
  - The `main` function initializes a stack of maze information (`Stack<info> maze`) and prompts the user for the number of mazes.
  - For each maze, users are prompted to input the number of rows and columns (`mazeRow` and `mazeCol`), maze ID, entrance and exit coordinates (`entX`, `entY`, `exX`, `exY`), and the number of visited blocks (`visitedBlocks`).

- **Maze Information Structure (`info`):**
  - The program utilizes a struct named `info` to store maze-related information.
  - `coord`: A vector storing the current coordinates within the maze.
  - `direc`: A vector representing the directions (North, East, South, West) with initial values set to 1.

### Instructions
1. **Number of Mazes:**
   - Enter the total number of mazes you want to solve.

2. **Maze Details:**
   - For each maze, provide the following details:
      - Number of rows and columns (M and N).
      - Maze ID.
      - Entrance and exit coordinates.
      - Number of visited blocks.

3. **Execution:**
   - Compile and run the program using a C++ compiler.
   - Follow the prompts to input maze details.

4. **Maze Solving:**
   - The program utilizes a stack to solve each maze and keeps track of the visited blocks.

### Notes
- This program was created as part of CS300 Homework 1.
